# Welcome to Kandoro!

This is a small app built with svelte, supabase, and svelte dnd. Incredibly easy to make using svelte and had no trouble making it with all the functionality required. Definately a great project to make as an introduction to svelte. I can happily say I really loved it and I learnt quite alot of svelte's wonderful features. 

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
